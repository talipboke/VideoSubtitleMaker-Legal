<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-01</p>

<p>
  This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Video Subtitle Maker</strong> mobile application
  (the “Application”), which is provided as a freemium service by
  <strong>Talip Böke</strong> (“Service Provider”, “we”, “us”).
  By installing or using the Application, you agree to the collection and use of information
  as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>
  When you download, install and use the Application, certain information may be collected
  automatically in order to operate, improve and analyze the service. This information may include:

<ul>
  <li>Your device’s IP address;</li>

  <li>Information related to in-app purchases (for example, coin packages you buy, transaction status, and country information provided by the store).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We do not collect precise GPS-level location. However, we may receive
  <strong>approximate location information</strong> (for example, country or region)
  via your IP address or analytics tools, which is used only in aggregated analytics,
  such as understanding where the Application is used most.
</p>

<p>
  If you contact us by email at <strong>rapinovatech@gmail.com</strong>,
  we may store your message and contact information in order to respond to your request
  and provide support.
</p>

  These third parties act under their own terms and privacy policies.
  We recommend that you review those policies to understand how your data is handled by them.

  We may share <strong>aggregated, anonymized information</strong> with third-party services
  for analytics, performance monitoring and improvement of the Application.
  Individual users are not intended to be identified from this data.
</p>

<p>
  We may also disclose information:

  you may contact us at <strong>rapinovatech@gmail.com</strong>.

  we will delete such information as soon as reasonably possible.

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
  We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information we process
  against unauthorized access, loss, misuse or disclosure. However, no method of transmission
  over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure,
  so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

  Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
  Your continued use of the Application after changes have been posted
