</p>

<h2>3. Freemium Model and In-App Purchases (Coins)</h2>

<p>
  The Application is offered as a freemium service: you can download and use it for free,
  and optionally purchase additional features or content inside the Application.
</p>

</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Consumable coin packages</strong> that can be spent inside the app (for example, to unlock certain actions or features);</li>
  <li><strong>Non-renewable coin packages</strong> or bundles that grant access to certain features or credits for a limited period or limited usage, without automatic renewal.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  All payments are processed by the app store (such as Apple’s App Store) under their own terms.
  The Service Provider does not store your full payment information and cannot directly issue refunds;
  any refund requests must be handled through the app store’s refund process
  where allowed by their policies.

  <li>May be modified, limited or discontinued at any time at our discretion.</li>
